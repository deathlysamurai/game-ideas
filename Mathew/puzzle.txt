We could do something like 2048 but maybe change it up a bit. Could do like 
hexadecimal numbers. Maybe a puzzle variant like http://mcsdwvl.github.io/to11/.
Maybe make it so you could choose what size grid you want to play on, and maybe
add other things you could choose.


Could make a puzzle game with logic gates. Maybe also have a level editor,
and/or an area just to mess with logic gates and learn something.

I really like little alchemy and the chill idea of just combining things, and
find new combinations, especially when a lot of them make sense.
