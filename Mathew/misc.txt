I really like how you can slowly figure out the right amount and distance.
(more like the warthog one could do like a pogo stick game?)

Like it says it is very simple, yet keeps me entertained, I love trying to

I really like the flying in this game and the fade in and out of the rooms when
you enter and leave them.
