I really like how you can slowly figure out the right amount and distance.
(more like the warthog one could do like a pogo stick game?)

Like it says it is very simple, yet keeps me entertained, I love trying to 
find hidden things.

This game is great, could try to do something like this.

I really like the flying in this game and the fade in and out of the rooms when
you enter and leave them.

For some reason this little diner scene spoke to me. I think it was mostly the
menu that drew my eye in. We could do something where you have to decide what
to put on the menu and decide the layout. And as you make more money the layout
of the diner/space changes and adds more cooking options and lets you make more
food. Could make that as an idle/clicker maybe as well.
