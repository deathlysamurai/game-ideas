I'm a big fan of rogue-lites. They reward you with a little something after each
run so you don't feel like you wasted your time if you die. I think I liked
some of what slay the spire and the newer peglin do.

Games like this where every run you get a little better due to things you can
buy. Goes along with the rogelite stuff I was talking about I think.
