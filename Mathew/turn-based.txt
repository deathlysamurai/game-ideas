In case first link doesn't work, it is from a comment on this post by shoulddev.
What I was thinking is that you could make a pool table tile based. You could
have different pool table setups and pool ball setups, and each ball would have
a value depending on where it is that would be the damage. Each player would 
start on the opposite side of the table with a cue ball they can hit. You can 
only hit your cue ball and your cue ball would act as a shield, can not be hit.
You would have a certain amount of "turns" which corresponds to how much you 
can move and how far the ball would go. When you are deciding which ball to hit
it will show you what will move based on which one you hit. When a ball hits 
another ball, the damage of each ball is added together if it hits the enemy.
