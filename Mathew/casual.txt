I really like the flying in this game and the fade in and out of the rooms when
you enter and leave them.

I really like how you can slowly figure out the right amount and distance.
(more like the warthog one could do like a pogo stick game?)

Like it says it is very simple, yet keeps me entertained, I love trying to 
find hidden things.

I've been playing a lot of stardew valley recently and was thinking about doing
a small thing with the fishing from there. Could be on a boat or something and
see the fish below you and catch the fish and earn money. Could also do 
multiplayer where a player is a fish and you have to catch them. Could also 
have the fish player not identified and the fisherman has to figure out which 
one it is.
