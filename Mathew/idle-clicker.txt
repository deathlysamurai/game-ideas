I'm always into idle/clicker games, I prefer when they have a more achievable 
goal. Don't have to play 100s of hours.

For some reason this little diner scene spoke to me. I think it was mostly the
menu that drew my eye in. We could do something where you have to decide what
to put on the menu and decide the layout. And as you make more money the layout
of the diner/space changes and adds more cooking options and lets you make more
food. Could make that as an idle/clicker maybe as well.
