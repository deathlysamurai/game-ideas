I think for the time being we should focus on something smaller. My inspiration for scale of the project is old flash games, such as what you would find on addictinggames.com or albinoblacksheep.com.

In terms of picking a type of game, I think we should focus on something that we would all enjoy playing. For me I know I like puzzle games, clicker games, and rogue-lite games (obviously among others). I like games that give me a sense of accomplishing something or slowly getting better through each playthrough.

I am going to add files with some game ideas that I have come up with, if any sound cool to you let me know.
