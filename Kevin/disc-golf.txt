And for my crazy idea. Disc golf. Could be fully 3d or some kinda isometric 
snes kinda feel.

Mathew Controls Suggestion: 
Could just use the sticks and make it dynamic. Left stick would be pushed forward
and tilt/angle would be determined based on where left stick is pushed. Right
stick would be used for power and direction of throw. While left stick is pushed
forward pull back right stick to grow power meter, when ready push right stick
forward and depending on where your finger ended up on the right stick would 
determine which direction your disc would fly.
